# 1d-mapping-explorations
A project to utilize my previous R package (not documented yet) SeriesXplorer on 1d mappings. Detection of periodicity, chaotic behaviors and animated visualizations are the major tasks. The secondary task is to test the acceleration of JIT on these codes. Videos will be uploaded to my YouTube channel. following CC. This repo follows MIT licence.
